# MediaIO - the Open Source item tracker and Team management webapp

## What is MediaIO? Why is it created?
MediaIO is an Open Source item tracker and team management app. Altough several management webapps are available, my case was different.  My team needed an app that is capable of tracking our items, and who is using them, create events in our calendar, define an in-house role management and track promotion points, which can lead to promotions in the end of the Month. Currently, it is only being developed by [me](https://github.com/d3rang3 "me") and is totally free for everone to contribute or use it for their own

### Key Features of MediaIO
By the time of writing, MediaIO is capable of:
- A simple registration/login system used to authenticate users ( even with Google Authenticator)
-  Track items, who currently rented them, and even show a graph, who used the specific item, and when.
- Manage an inhouse calendar, allowing users to edit, remove and add events, even worksheets to events
- Provide a connection to an FTP fileserver ( in development)
- Manage a "promotion table", allowing Administrators to manage users "points"
- Expense/Income tracking
- Item Storage/user statistics ( in development)

###### Although mediaIO was initally just a test, nowadays it is widely used in my workgroup as a central management system.
## Currently known issues
- A large portion of MediaIO is written in Hungarian. The app lacks translation and it is hard to understand. **- Help is NEEDED!**
- With the implementation of 2FA, the app recieved some security bugs. More testing is required to hunt the bugs  **- Help is NEEDED!**
- Currently I am not capable of hosting a demo. A demo Database has to be created too for further portability.

In the current development phase, **every help is appreciated!**
